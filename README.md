# Stocks
A Stock Portfolio Management System where users can create portfolios and interact with them. Created in June 2024 for Northeastern University's CS3500: Object Oriented Design

This program allows users to create portfolios and implements key financial computations, including analysing the gain/loss of a portfolio, X-day moving averages, and crossover detection. It also facillitates saving and retriving portfolios so a user can have multiple portfolios going at a time. The program can be run using a GUI (shown below) or a command line interface.
